        <p>
          Hey, hey
Bye bye bye, bye bye <br>
Bye bye<br>
I'm doing this tonight<br>
You're probably gonna start a fight<br>
I know this can't be right<br>
Hey baby come on<br>
I loved you endlessly<br>
When you weren't there for me<br>
So now it's time to leave and make it alone<br>
I know that I can't take no more<br>
It ain't no lie<br>
I want to see you out that door<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
Don't want to be a fool for you<br>
Just another player in your game for two<br>
You may hate me but it ain't no lie<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
Bye bye<br>
Don't really want to make it tough<br>
I just want to tell you that I've had enough<br>
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
You just hit me with the truth<br>
Now girl you're more than welcome to<br>
So give me one good reason<br>
Baby come on<br>
I've lived for you and me<br>
And now I really come to see<br>
That life would be much better once you're gone<br>
I know that I can't take no more<br>
It ain't no lie<br>
I want to see you out that door<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
Don't want to be a fool for you<br>
Just another player in your game for two<br>
You may hate me but it ain't no lie<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
Bye bye<br>
Don't really want to make it tough<br>
I just want to tell you that I've had enough<br>
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
I'm giving up I know for sure<br>
I don't' want to be the reason for your love no more<br>
Bye bye<br>
I'm checking out, I'm signing off<br>
I don't want to be the loser, and I've had enough<br>
I don't want to be your fool in this game for two<br>
So I'm leaving you behind<br>
(Bye bye bye)<br>
I don't want to make it tough<br>
(Make it tough)<br>
But I've had enough<br>
And it ain't no lie<br>
Don't want to be a fool for you<br>
Just another player in your game for two<br>
I don't want to be your fool<br>
But it ain't no lie<br>
Baby bye bye bye<br>
Bye bye<br>
Don't really want to make it tough<br>
I just want to tell you that I've had enough<br>
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br>
Bye bye<br>
